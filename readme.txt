1)To run the program, open pycharm and run classifyImage.py
2)classifyImage.py shows two results. One from custom network model and another from pre-trained network model.
2)To test the system, there are images located in 'Images To Test' folder. You can choose from that folder or can choose of your own.
3)'Building Custom Neural Network', and 'Training Custom Neural Network' folders contains steps to build and train our custom network for the Image Classification
4)'Using Pre-trained Network' folder contains the .py file that predicts the image from a pre-trained network (VGG-16 CNN)
